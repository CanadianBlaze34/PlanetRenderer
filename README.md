# PlanetRenderer
###A repo for my research on planet rendering in c++ | opengl

####Description
This will grow over the next few months as I add more content. Nothing is set in stone yet, I am currently researching terrain algorithms.

So far there is a subdividing icosahedron that can change subdivision levels recursivly in real time.

####Content
A lot of the code for the framework is copied from my openGL framework, but since I want a barebones techdemo as a result in order to keep all the code relevant, I did not code this in the framework itself.

Currently there is context managment, time, input managment, window settings, opengl and sdl initialization, shaders, camera and transforms.

####Libraries
Libraries used: SDL2, GLM, OpenGL - in the future also DevIL
